# Progamable-Logic-Controller-Projects-
This projects ware my course project, which I completed with my classmates while pursuing my BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) at East West University, Bangladesh.
1st project:
# PLC-Based Bottle Filling System  
A gravity-fed automated filling system controlled by Siemens S7-1200 PLC.  

## Features  
- Photoelectric bottle detection.  
- Timer-controlled filling (10s Â±1% tolerance).  
- Overflow/overload safety mechanisms.  

## Simulation  
![Ladder Logic](Diagrams/Ladder_Logic.png)  
*LogoSoft simulation validated timing accuracy.*  

## Usage  
1. Upload `LogoSoft_Program.lsc` to PLC.
2. Report-PLC_Automating filling system
